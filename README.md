- Continue to invest in and expand inventory for high-performing clusters/products like SHIRT and LADIES SUITS to maximize revenue.


### 2. **Address Stock Imbalances:**

- Investigate negative stock difference (especially in Cluster 3) to prevent stock-outs or overstocking.
- Introduce automated inventory tracking and alerts.


### 3. **Promote High Turnover Products:**

- Ramp up promotion for fast-moving lines like Towels, Hankies, and Yoga Pant.
- Consider expanding the range in these categories.


### 4. **Boost Underperforming Categories:**
